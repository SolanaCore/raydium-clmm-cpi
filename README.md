# 🧠 Raydium CLMM CPI

This Solana smart contract enables **CPI (Cross-Program Invocation)** calls to the **Raydium CLMM** contract.

It provides essential functions for interacting with concentrated liquidity pools via CPI.

---

## ✨ Features

This contract supports:

* 🛠️ `create_pool` – Create a new Raydium CLMM pool
* 📍 `open_position` – Open a new liquidity position in a pool
* 🔼 `increase_liquidity` – Add liquidity to an existing position
* 🔽 `decrease_liquidity` – Withdraw liquidity from a position
* ❌ `close_position` – Close a liquidity position and reclaim funds

---

## 📦 Use Case

This CPI module is designed to be integrated into a broader smart contract, specifically the **Pump Program**. In that program:

* Once **800,000,000 tokens are sold**, the system:

  * Either **opens a position** in an existing pool
  * Or first **creates a pool**, then **opens a position**

This modular design allows flexible and programmable DeFi logic using Raydium’s liquidity infrastructure.
